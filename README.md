# Description
In the current state of the meals app, in the **HomeCategoriesTab** widget, the meal categories are already animated as a whole and performs a simple slide in animation from below. In this lab, we want you to implement the slide in effect **row by row** (Staggered animation). 

The animation should occour everytime that the items bulids, for example, switching from favorites tab to categories tab.

Keep in mind that in order to achieve the smoothness of animation effects in the example video, **there's some math involved**, such as calculating the start and end time of the animation, or some animation overlapping. 

The following is an example of the animation timeline, where the X axis is the value of the Animation controller.

# Grading


1. App compiles and runs with all of it's original functions  **(20%)**  
  

2. Implement the staggered animation to each row of the categories tab, we only grade on whether each row palys the animation sequentially, smoothness and aesthetics are not graded.**(80%)** 



# Hints
- Go through the thought tutorial provided below and pay special attention to the **Interval** class since it's used to delay the animation curve.

- Each item in the grid view acts differently, so you may need to apply animation to each of them separately.

- Refer to other existing animations in this project and see how they do the implementations
